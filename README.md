# heavyaidra
IRC-based mass router scanner/exploiter using SSH and kaiten.
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Because lightaidra didn't work well, ddos was broken, spreading was broken, and would never re-connect after pinging out. Kaiten is responsible for the stable bot in heavyaidra, and the scanner I work spreads flawlessy.</p>
